# Gas_Detector
This gas leak detection project utilizes an ESP8266, a gas sensor, an LCD, an RGB LED, and a buzzer for alerting. The Blynk platform is used for remote monitoring and notifications. When the gas concentration exceeds a defined threshold, the RGB LED changes color, the buzzer sounds, and a notification is sent via Blynk.
